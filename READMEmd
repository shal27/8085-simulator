8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor.
SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros which provide an event-driven simulation interface. SystemC processes can communicate in a simulated real-time environment, using signals of all the datatypes offered by C++, some additional ones offered by the SystemC library, as well as user defined.
In certain respects, SystemC deliberately mimics the hardware description languages VHDL and Verilog, but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language.
SystemC is applied to system-level modeling, architectural exploration, performance modeling, software development, functional verification, and high-level synthesis. SystemC is often associated with electronic system-level (ESL) design, and with transaction-level modeling (TLM).
These facilities enable a designer to simulate concurrent processes, each described using plain C++ syntax.
I have made several modules that implement 8085 and connect all the ports that a module have.
